### Airdrop details

---

`confirms.json` - contains addresses eligible to receive tokens during generation.

Data prepared before the network launch, which will be included in
genesis.json - the configuration file from which the network starts
its work.

**The data includes addresses of:**
1. Participants in the airdrop
2. Participants in testing
3. Team addresses
4. Active user addresses

The list of addresses that participated in the airdrop is available in a separate repository: https://github.com/aaronetwork/airdrop-data

If an address received the airdrop and participated in testing, rewards will be cumulative. If an address did not participate in the airdrop but joined the testing, the reward will be given only for testing and other activities, excluding airdrop rewards.
